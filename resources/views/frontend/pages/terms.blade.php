                                        nformal negotiations. To expedite resolution and reduce the cost of any dispute, controversy or claim between you and us related to this Agreement (“Dispute”), you and we agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) informally for at least thirty (30) days before initiating any arbitration or court proceeding. Such informal negotiations will commence upon written notice. Your address for such notices is your billing address, with an email copy to the email address you have provided to us. Our address for such notices is Legal@handsomeservice.com with the subject line reading: Legal binding arbitration. If you and we are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, all claims arising from use of the Platform (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration. Any election to arbitrate by one party will be final and binding on the other. you understand that if either party elects to arbitrate, neither party will have the right to sue in court or have a jury trial. The arbitration will be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules (the “AAA Rules”) of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (“AAA Consumer Rules”), both of which are available at the AAA website www.adr.org. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation will be governed by the AAA Rules (and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules). If your claim for damages does not exceed USD 10,000, We will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)). The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone or online. The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, you and we may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceeding pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.
            Exceptions to alternative dispute resolution. Claims where mandatory arbitration is prohibited by a valid, non-preempted law, including claims under the Private Attorneys General Act of 2004, California Labor Code § 2698 et seq. (“PAGA”) to the extent waiver of such a claim is deemed unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, are not covered by this arbitration provision. Nothing in this arbitration provision will prevent either party from bringing an individual action in small claims court or to seek injunctive or other equitable relief on an individual basis the state or federal courts located in New York, New York, with respect to any dispute related to the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s intellectual property or proprietary rights.</p>
            <p>Waiver of right to be a plaintiff or class member in a purported class action or representative proceeding. You and we agree that any arbitration will be limited to the Dispute between us and you individually. you acknowledge and agree that you and we are each waiving the right to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding. Further,unless both you and we otherwise agree, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding.
                Location of arbitration. Arbitration will take place in New York, New York. You and we agree that for any Dispute not subject to arbitration (other than claims proceeding in any small claims court), or where no election to arbitrate has been made, the state or federal courts located in New York, New York have exclusive jurisdiction and you and we agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts.
